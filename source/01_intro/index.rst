Getting Started with Django
===========================

In this section you'll learn about Django's core components and how they work together to create a web application. Our goal is to master the *vocabulary* of Django before moving on to more complex projects.

By the end of this section you'll have built and deployed a simple application and will understand:

* how Django works with databases
* how to respond to HTTP requests
* how to validate and process user input
* how Django handles CSS and other assets
* how to deploy your application to Heroku and Digital Ocean
