==================
 Effective Django
==================

This repository contains the source to accompany the `Effective
Django`_ tutorial.

When building *Effective Django*, Tut_ checks out specific branches to
include the code at that point in time. Because of this, patches and
pull requests are usually applied manually, and may be split into
multiple commits. I try to maintain patch authorship; all patch
authors are listed in CONTRIBUTORS.txt.
