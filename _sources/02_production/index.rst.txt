=======================
Building for Production
=======================

Congratulations, you've built and deployed your first Django project. In this section we'll take what you learned in the last section and work on building a more complicated project. By the end of this section you'll have built and deployed a photo-blogging project, and will understand:

* how to implement social login in your Django project
* how to handle user uploads
* how to create database indexes for your models
* how to create background tasks that handle asynchronous processing
* how to localize your Django project
* how to configure logging so you know how your project is performing

There's a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
