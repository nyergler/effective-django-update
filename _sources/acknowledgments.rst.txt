Acknowledgments
===============

These documents are a combination of the notes and examples developed
for talks prepared for PyCon 2012, PyOhio 2012, and PyCon 2013, and
for Eventbrite web engineering. I'm still working on fleshing them out
into a single document, but I hope you find them useful.

It would have been impossible to put *Effective Django* together with
lots and lots of help. Thanks to PyCon_ and PyOhio_ for allowing me to
speak about these topics and develop the material. Thanks to
Eventbrite_ for supporting my work in this area, and generally just
being an awesome place to work.

*Effective Django* would have been opaque, disjointed, and confusing
without feedback and patience from early reviewers: Tamara Chu,
Brandon L. Golm, Jason Herbst, Philip John James, Galen Krumel,
Allison Lacker, Sanby Lee, Karl Mendes, Nam-Chi Van, Nicole Zuckerman,
and Madeline_.

Thanks for reading this far. If you have feedback, comments, or
suggestions, please feel free to email them to me: nathan@yergler.net.
